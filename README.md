# reddam pokemon go

My first ever game created as a mobile application and a admin dashboard all connected together through a real time backend.

I was asked by my school teacher to create a game for students from Year 5 (primary school) to learn about the middle/senior part of my school. I was given a schematic of the school which I simplified in Photoshop and then displayed it on the mobile app. The purpose of the game is for students to find as many rooms in the building as possible which are picked at random. When the time ends, the winner is calculated or if a team finds all the rooms, the duration of how long it took them is saved and they are classified as the winner. The game would be run on the school's Junior iPads.

# first run (2023)

it was a massive success, the only problem was that since Year 5's are running around the building, the Wi-Fi connection sometimes disconnected which affected some players.
